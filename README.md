# hello-world

Hello, everybody! Zachary, here!

I am just a Christian guy looking to do academic research to some capacity in the world of Christian and Biblical Scholarship! If anyone is interested in archaeology, anthropology, textual criticism, linguistics, history, and other related fields, be sure to hit me up! I'd love to discuss all that (and the Bible) over a cup of coffee!
